# HED
A multi-sequence MRI-based hierarchical expert diagnostic method for the molecular subtype of breast cancer.  
This experiment was done using a server with 24GB NVIDIA GTX 4090 GPU.  
The code was written in Python 3.7 using the open-source PyTorch 1.13 library.   
The batch size of 16.  
The initial learning rate was 0.01, weight decay of 5*10^-4, 200 training generations, and saving the best-performing model on the validation set during training.
